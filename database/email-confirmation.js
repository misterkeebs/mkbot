      Hey there,

      Someone, hopefully you, requested to confirm this email to be used with MKBot.

      If you are user ${user.username}#${user.discriminator} on Discord and if this request was made by you, please click here to confirm:

      ${process.env.BASE_URL}/api/confirm/${this.token}

      If you didn't request this, please ignore this email.

      Best,
      MKBot
